# AutoApply AI — Session Log

## Session 1 — 2026-02-20

### Completed

**Step 3a: Backend CRUD API routes** — All created and type-checked:
- `apps/web/app/api/profile/route.ts` — GET/POST for master profile
- `apps/web/app/api/profile/upload/route.ts` — POST for CV file upload
- `apps/web/app/api/preferences/route.ts` — GET/PUT for job preferences
- `apps/web/app/api/applications/route.ts` — GET list with status filter
- `apps/web/app/api/applications/[id]/route.ts` — GET single + PATCH status update
- `apps/web/app/api/jobs/route.ts` — GET with search/source/minScore filters
- `apps/web/app/api/stats/route.ts` — GET dashboard stats (counts, averages, by-status)
- `apps/web/app/api/user/route.ts` — GET user info + PATCH automation toggle
- `apps/web/app/api/account/route.ts` — GET data export + DELETE GDPR deletion
- `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` — Shared auth helper (getAuthUser)

**Step 3b: Dashboard page wired:**
- Server Component fetches real stats and applications from Prisma
- Created `components/kanban-board.tsx` — client component with @hello-pangea/dnd
- Drag-drop moves cards between columns, PATCH to /api/applications/[id]
- Optimistic updates with revert on failure

**Step 3c: Jobs page wired:**
- Client component with search, source filter, min score filter
- Debounced search with 300ms delay
- "Paste Job" inline dialog (title, company, URL, description) → POST /api/tailor
- "Tailor CV" button per job card → POST /api/tailor
- Job cards show match score, ATS keywords, source badge
- Links to document viewer for completed applications

**Step 3d: Profile page wired:**
- Client component with file upload (drag-drop + file picker)
- Raw text paste with "Save & Parse"
- Structured profile editor (contact, summary, skills)
- Loading spinner, success/error messages

**Step 3e: Settings page wired:**
- Fetches user info + preferences on mount
- Job preferences form (titles, locations, remote, salary, industries) → PUT /api/preferences
- Automation toggle → PATCH /api/user
- Real subscription status and credits display
- Export data → GET /api/account → JSON download
- Delete account with two-click confirmation → DELETE /api/account

**Step 3f: Document viewer wired:**
- Server Component fetches application + job + master profile
- Shows compatibility score, ATS keywords, strengths, gaps
- Side-by-side: original CV (raw text) vs tailored CV (Markdown rendered)
- Cover letter section with Markdown rendering
- Download buttons for PDF URLs when available

### What's Next
- Step 4: Build Flutter mobile app functionality (Clerk SDK, Riverpod providers, API calls)
- OR continue web refinements:
  - Stripe checkout integration on pricing/upgrade buttons
  - Onboarding flow for new users
  - Loading skeletons (shimmer) instead of spinner
  - Error boundaries

### Blockers / Decisions
- CV upload currently only accepts .txt files (client-side text extraction). For PDF/DOCX parsing, need to either add server-side deps (pdf-parse, mammoth) or use an external service.
- Stripe checkout buttons (Upgrade, Buy Credits) are present but not yet linked to Stripe checkout sessions.
- The `@clerk/nextjs@4.29` has a peer dep conflict with `next@14.1.0` — installed with `--legacy-peer-deps`. Consider upgrading Clerk or Next.js.

---

## Session 2 — 2026-02-20 (continued)

### Completed

**Web App — Auth & Checkout:**
- Clerk sign-in/sign-up pages at /sign-in and /sign-up
- Stripe checkout API route (POST /api/checkout) for Pro/Unlimited/Credit Pack
- Upgrade buttons wired to Stripe checkout sessions

**Web App — CV Upload Parsing:**
- Server-side PDF parsing (pdf-parse) and DOCX parsing (mammoth)
- POST /api/profile/upload accepts multipart FormData
- Extracts raw text + structured profile (name, email, phone, skills, experience)

**Web App — Onboarding:**
- /onboarding page with 3-step wizard (profile, preferences, CV upload)
- GET/POST /api/onboarding route for checking/saving progress
- Auto-redirect from dashboard for new users

**Web App — UI Polish:**
- LoadingSkeleton component (shimmer animations)
- ErrorBoundary component (catch + retry)
- Cookie consent banner (GDPR compliant, saves preference)

**Web App — Legal Pages:**
- /terms, /privacy, /contact pages with full content

**Web App — Tests:**
- 6 test files, 24 tests total (all passing):
  - stats.test.ts, profile.test.ts, preferences.test.ts
  - applications.test.ts, checkout.test.ts, llm-validation.test.ts
- vitest.config.ts + mocked Clerk/Prisma/Stripe modules

---

## Session 3 — 2026-02-21

### Completed

  - jobs_page.dart — job feed, paste job dialog, tailor button
  - profile_page.dart — CV display/edit, preferences form
  - document_viewer_page.dart — tailored CV/cover letter tabs, score badge, ATS chips

- New core files:
  - models.dart — UserModel, DashboardStats, MasterProfile, JobPreferences, Job, Application
  - api_service.dart — Centralized Dio-based API service
  - auth_provider.dart — Riverpod StateNotifier auth flow with FlutterSecureStorage
  - providers.dart — FutureProviders for stats, profile, preferences, applications, jobs

- PostgreSQL running, schema in sync

### What's Next
- User will provide VPS access for deployment
- Deploy: Vercel (web), Railway/DO (n8n + services)
- Set up Stripe products in dashboard
- Configure production environment variables

### Blockers / Decisions
- Docker not installed on Mac (only broken symlinks remain)
- Xcode not installed — cannot build native iOS/macOS Flutter apps locally
- Flutter mobile app uses demo auth (not real Clerk Flutter SDK yet)
- Stripe keys are placeholder — need production setup

---

## Session 4 — 2026-02-22

### Completed

**Admin Account & Auth Fixes (from prev context):**
- Created `prisma/seed.ts` — admin user (matthieu.kokabi@gmail.com) with Unlimited plan, 9999 credits
- 5 sample jobs (Stripe, Vercel, DeepMind, N26, Notion) + 5 sample applications
- Fixed user creation race condition: centralized all user creation in `lib/auth.ts` → `getAuthUser()`
- Fixed `(dashboard)/layout.tsx` and `api/onboarding/route.ts` to use `getAuthUser()` instead of direct `prisma.user.create()`
- Enhanced sign-in/sign-up pages with better styling
- LinkedIn OAuth enabled via Clerk Dashboard (shared credentials for dev)
- Phone verification disabled in Clerk

**Stripe — Full Integration:**
- API keys configured (test mode — AutoApply sandbox)
- 3 products created in Stripe Dashboard:
  - AutoApply Pro: $29/mo (price_1T3LmSCObkaQqcv27oj42Mae) + $249/yr (price_1T3LmSCObkaQqcv2upF4ZJxB)
  - AutoApply Unlimited: $79/mo (price_1T3LolCObkaQqcv2PsDAFiDM)

  - checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted
  - invoice.payment_succeeded, invoice.payment_failed
- Stripe Customer Portal configured (payments, invoices, cancel, plan switching)
- Stripe Branding set (#2563EB brand, #1E40AF accent, "AutoApply" name)

**Clerk — Production Instance:**
- Production instance created for autoapply.works
- Frontend API URL: https://clerk.autoapply.works
- Instance ID: ins_39zqMLJuFyCTNUeIm1CMb4tIe7e

**Domain — autoapply.works:**
- Purchased on Hostinger
- DNS: CNAME clerk → frontend-api.clerk.services (for Clerk auth)
- Email forwarding via ForwardEmail.net (DNS-based, free):
  - support@autoapply.works → matthieu.kokabi@gmail.com
  - noreply@autoapply.works → matthieu.kokabi@gmail.com
  - contact@autoapply.works → matthieu.kokabi@gmail.com
- MX records: mx1.forwardemail.net (pri 10), mx2.forwardemail.net (pri 20)

### .env Keys (Test Mode)
- All keys are in the .env file (gitignored — not in repo)
- Clerk: pk_test_... / sk_test_...
- Stripe: pk_test_... / sk_test_...
- Stripe Webhook: whsec_...
- All 4 Stripe price IDs configured
- See "New Machine Setup" section below for full .env contents (share privately, not in git)

### What's Next
1. Test Stripe checkout flow end-to-end (Path A — use test card 4242 4242 4242 4242)
2. Fix landing page if styling issue persists
3. Deploy to Vercel (add A record + CNAME www to Hostinger DNS)
4. Set production env vars on Vercel
5. Set Clerk production keys on Vercel

### Setup Instructions for New Machine
See SESSION_LOG.md "New Machine Setup" section below.

---

## New Machine Setup — How to Continue

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (`brew install node` or `nvm install 20`)
- PostgreSQL 16 (`brew install postgresql@16 && brew services start postgresql@16`)
- Git configured with GitHub access
- Flutter SDK (for mobile app only)

### Step-by-step
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MattMenworworksAI/AutoApply-AI.git
cd AutoApply-AI

# 2. Install web dependencies
cd apps/web
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 3. Create the database
createdb autoapply
psql autoapply -c "CREATE USER autoapply WITH PASSWORD 'autoapply_dev_123';"
psql autoapply -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE autoapply TO autoapply;"
psql autoapply -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO autoapply;"

# 4. Copy .env (IMPORTANT — .env is gitignored, you MUST recreate it)
# Copy the .env file from your current Mac to the new machine.
# The easiest way: on your CURRENT Mac, run:
#   cat apps/web/.env | pbcopy
# Then on the NEW Mac, create the file:
#   nano apps/web/.env   (paste contents, save)
# OR use AirDrop/iCloud to transfer the .env file directly.

# 5. Push schema + seed database
npx prisma db push
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts

# 6. Run dev server
npm run dev

# 7. Run tests
npm test
```

### Claude Code Prompt to Continue

## Session 5 — 2026-02-27

### Completed

**Landing Page — Complete Redesign:**
- Gradient hero text, stats bar (4 APIs, 100+ keywords, 0 fabricated, 4h cycle)
- "How It Works" 3-step section
- Features grid on muted background
- Pricing cards with checkmark lists and real Stripe checkout buttons
- CTA banner section before footer
- 4-column footer (brand, product, legal, data sources)

**Dark Mode — Full Implementation:**
- Installed `next-themes` package
- `components/theme-provider.tsx` — wraps app with system/light/dark detection
- `components/theme-toggle.tsx` — sun/moon icon toggle button
- Root layout updated with ThemeProvider (defaults to system preference)
- Dashboard sidebar has toggle next to user avatar
- Landing page header has toggle
- CSS dark mode variables were already defined — now properly activated

**Stripe Checkout — Wired to UI:**
- `components/checkout-button.tsx` — client component calling POST /api/checkout
- Pro Monthly, Pro Yearly, Unlimited, Credit Pack buttons all trigger real Stripe sessions
- Free tier links to /sign-up

**Production Deployment — Vercel:**
- Deployed to Vercel (project: auto-apply-ai)
- Root directory: `apps/web`, Framework: Next.js
- Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to fix Clerk peer dep conflict
- 17 environment variables configured on Vercel
- Live at: https://auto-apply-ai-psi.vercel.app

**Production Database — Neon:**
- Created Neon project `autoapply` in Frankfurt (EU)
- PostgreSQL 17, connection pooling enabled
- Prisma schema pushed, database seeded (admin + 5 sample jobs + 5 applications)
- Connection string: ep-morning-meadow-ag8qe5hq-pooler.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech

**Domain — autoapply.works → Vercel:**
- A record: `@` → `216.198.79.1` (Vercel)
- CNAME: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- Existing records preserved (clerk CNAME, MX, TXT)
- SSL auto-provisioned by Vercel
- Site live at: https://autoapply.works ✅

**Build & Tests:**
- `next build` — 0 errors
- `vitest run` — 24/24 tests passing

### What's Next
1. **Switch Clerk to production keys** — currently using test keys, auth won't work on autoapply.works until production Clerk keys are set
2. **Deploy n8n + Gotenberg to Render** — automation engine for job discovery
3. **Add more job board APIs** — JSearch (RapidAPI), Jooble, Reed.co.uk, RSS feeds
4. **Email notifications** — SendGrid/Resend for "new jobs matched" alerts
5. **More tests** — component tests, E2E flow tests

### Blockers / Decisions
- Clerk production keys (ins_39zqMLJuFyCTNUeIm1CMb4tIe7e) need to be set on Vercel — currently test keys are deployed, so sign-in on autoapply.works won't work with production Clerk
- n8n needs a hosting platform (Render recommended) — not yet set up
- Stripe webhook secret needs updating if URL changes from test to production

---

## Session 9 — 2026-03-01

### Completed

**Flutter Mobile App — Real Auth + API Integration:**

**Backend — Mobile Auth Endpoint:**
- `apps/web/app/api/auth/mobile/route.ts` — POST endpoint for sign-in/sign-up
  - Clerk Backend API: `createUser()` for sign-up, `getUserList()` + `verifyPassword()` for sign-in
  - Returns custom JWT (HS256, 30-day expiry) signed with CLERK_SECRET_KEY via jose
  - Fixed Clerk v4 compatibility (import from `@clerk/nextjs`, not `@clerk/nextjs/server`)
- `apps/web/lib/mobile-auth.ts` — JWT signing (`createMobileToken`) and verification (`verifyMobileToken`)
  - Issuer: `autoapply-mobile`, Algorithm: HS256
- `jose` npm package installed for JWT operations

**Backend — Dual Auth (Web + Mobile):**
- Updated `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` — `getAuthUser(req?)` now supports:
  1. Clerk session auth (web) — tries `auth()` first
  2. Bearer JWT auth (mobile) — falls back to Authorization header
  3. Auto-creates user in database from either auth source
- **All 12 API routes updated** to pass `req` to `getAuthUser(req)`:
  - profile, stats, preferences, applications, applications/[id], jobs, tailor, profile/upload, onboarding, user, account, checkout

**Flutter — Auth System:**
- `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart` — AuthService with:
  - Sign-in/sign-up via POST /api/auth/mobile
  - Token persistence in FlutterSecureStorage
  - Auto-login check, sign-out with storage clear
- `lib/core/auth/auth_provider.dart` — Riverpod StateNotifierProvider:
  - AuthStatus enum (initial, loading, authenticated, unauthenticated, error)
  - signIn(), signUp(), signOut(), checkAuth() methods
  - Error message propagation to UI

**Flutter — Environment Config:**
- `lib/core/config/env_config.dart` — EnvConfig with:
  - Platform-aware defaults (localhost for iOS, 10.0.2.2 for Android)
  - Support for dev/staging/production environments
  - flutter_dotenv integration
- `.env.example` created with API_BASE_URL and ENVIRONMENT vars
- `.env` created for local development

**Flutter — Dio Client & Auth Interceptor:**
- Updated `lib/core/network/dio_client.dart`:
  - Reads auth token from FlutterSecureStorage
  - Injects Bearer token into all requests
  - 401 response → auto-logout (clears storage, resets auth state)

**Flutter — Login Page Wired:**
- `login_page.dart` — Full sign-in/sign-up flow:
  - Email validation regex
  - Password length check (8+ chars) for sign-up
  - Calls `signUp()` or `signIn()` based on toggle
  - Uses reactive auth state for loading indicator
  - Navigation to dashboard on success, SnackBar on error

**Flutter — CV File Upload:**
- `profile_page.dart` — Added file picker:
  - FilePicker.platform.pickFiles() for PDF/DOCX/DOC/TXT
  - 5MB file size limit
  - Multipart upload via FormData
  - "OR" divider between file upload and text paste
- `api_service.dart` — Added `uploadProfileFile()` method with MultipartFile

**Flutter — Dependencies Added:**
- flutter_secure_storage, flutter_dotenv, file_picker, url_launcher

**Build Verification:**
- `next build` — 0 errors, all 34 routes compiled
- `flutter analyze` — 0 errors (11 info-level style hints only)
- widget_test.dart updated (removed stale MyApp reference)

### Git Commits This Session
- `f16b304` — feat: wire Flutter mobile auth + update all backend routes for dual auth

### What's Next
1. **Social media setup** — Twitter/X, LinkedIn company page, ProductHunt listing
2. **Email notifications** — SendGrid/Resend for job match alerts
3. **Deploy n8n** — Render or Railway for automation engine
4. **Flutter — remaining pages** — Wire dashboard, jobs, documents pages to real API data
5. **End-to-end testing** — Test full mobile auth flow against production

### Blockers / Decisions
- n8n still needs hosting platform deployment
- Need actual JSearch, Jooble, Reed API keys for production
- Flutter mobile app can now auth against the backend but remaining pages (dashboard, jobs, documents) still use provider stubs
- Clerk production keys need to be set for mobile auth to work against autoapply.works
